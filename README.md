# Backend Developer Test Task (Laravel)

## Overview

This task is designed for the position of a Back-End Developer with Laravel knowledge. The goal is to create an admin
panel for managing administrators with specific functionality for login, admin management, and avatar handling. The
project must be hosted on a server for review.

### Hosting

You are required to host the project on your server for evaluation. If you are unable to do so, we will provide a test
server.

**Important**: No pre-built admin panels are allowed.

### 1. **Admin Panel - Authorization**

Create the admin part of the website with an authentication system.

- **Login fields**:
    - **Email**: Must be in the correct format.
    - **Password**: Must have a minimum length (define the minimum length, e.g., 6 characters).

  Validation must be implemented for both fields.

### 2. **Admin Panel - Administrators**

Develop a section called **"Administrators"** in the admin panel.

#### **Section Structure**:

- **General Overview**:
    - Display a list of all admins in a table.
    - Columns: **Email**, **Name**, **Status** (active or inactive).
    - **Actions**:
        - Add new admin.
        - Edit an existing admin.
        - Delete an admin.

- **Filters**:
    - Filter by **active/inactive** status.
    - Search by **email** or **name**.

#### **Creating a New Admin**:

Create a page with the following fields for adding a new admin:

- **Name**:
    - Validation: Must not be empty and contain at least 4 characters.

- **Email**:
    - Validation: Must be in a valid email format and the email must not already exist in the database.

- **Password**:
    - Validation: Must not be empty and contain at least 4 characters.

- **Status**:
    - A dropdown with the options: **Active** or **Inactive**.

All fields must be mandatory for submission.

#### **Editing an Admin**:

Create a page with editable fields for modifying an existing admin:

- **Email**: Same validation as creating a new admin but check that the new email doesnâ€™t already exist.
- **Password**: Same validation as creating a new admin.
- **Status**: A dropdown to select **Active** or **Inactive**.

All fields are mandatory for editing.

#### **No Role System**:

- There is no role-based system. Every user created will have admin rights.
- All users must be able to log into the admin panel with their credentials.

### 3. **Admin Panel - Admins and Avatar**

#### **Avatar Handling**:

- Add an **Avatar** field when creating or editing an admin.
- The Avatar should be uploaded using a file manager (not a basic input field).
